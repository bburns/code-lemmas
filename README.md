Lemmas
====================

A small set of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java.

In a way these correspond to lemmas in mathematics - if you think of the built in data types and operations as axioms, and programs as theorems, these are the intermediate building blocks, and used in libraries and collection classes.

These are basically just learning exercises for me, so they're implemented much better elsewhere.
