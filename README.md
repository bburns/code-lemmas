Lemmas
====================

A small set of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java.

These are like lemmas in mathematics - if the built in data types and operations of a language correspond to axioms, and programs to theorems, then these are the intermediate building blocks between them, as used in libraries and collection classes.

These are basically just learning exercises for me, and are implemented much better elsewhere. In other words, don't use them for building medical device software!
